# Integration Test Plan: Blackbox End-to-End Suite

## Overview

Full blackbox test suite that spins up the Docker container and exercises the app
through its public surface: the HTTP API and the browser UI.

**Test runner:** Playwright (TypeScript)
**Why Playwright:** already in the Node/TS ecosystem, handles both API requests and
browser automation in one tool, first-class Docker lifecycle support via `globalSetup`.

## Infrastructure

### Container lifecycle (`global-setup.ts`)

1. Generate a temp DB path: `/tmp/grocery-e2e-<timestamp>.db`
2. `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.e2e.yml up -d --build`
   - The e2e override mounts the temp DB path instead of `./`
3. Poll `GET http://localhost:8080/api/bootstrap` every 500 ms, up to 30 s
4. On timeout → tear down and throw (fail fast)

### `docker-compose.e2e.yml` (override)

```yaml
services:
  grocery:
    volumes:
      - /tmp/grocery-e2e:/data   # fresh DB, not the dev one
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
```

### `global-teardown.ts`

1. `docker compose down --volumes`
2. Remove temp DB file

### Isolation between test files

Each `*.spec.ts` file runs in its own Playwright worker.
API tests call `POST /api/sync` to seed then clean state.
UI tests use the page fixture's `seedViaApi()` / `resetViaApi()` helpers to put the
app in a known state before each `test()`.

## API test scenarios

### `bootstrap.spec.ts`

| # | Scenario | What is asserted |
|---|----------|-----------------|
| 1 | Empty database | HTTP 200; body has all 10 array keys; all arrays are `[]` (not `null`) |
| 2 | After seeding one shop | `shops` array has length 1; object has expected fields |
| 3 | `serverTime` field | Parses as valid ISO-8601 date; close to `Date.now()` |
| 4 | Content-Type header | `application/json` |

### `sync.spec.ts`

| # | Scenario | What is asserted |
|---|----------|-----------------|
| 1 | Empty payload (no changes) | HTTP 200; `applied = []`; `conflicts = []`; `serverChanges` has empty arrays |
| 2 | Create a shop | `applied` contains the shop UUID; subsequent bootstrap returns the shop |
| 3 | Create an item | `applied` contains item UUID; item appears in bootstrap |
| 4 | Create a list + list item | Both UUIDs in `applied`; bootstrap reflects them |
| 5 | Update an existing entity | `applied` contains UUID; updated field visible in bootstrap |
| 6 | Conflict: same entity changed on both sides | `conflicts` array has one entry with `entity`, `id`, `client`, `server` keys |
| 7 | Soft delete (deleted_at set) | Entity absent from bootstrap `items`; still present in DB (not hard-deleted) |
| 8 | `lastSyncedAt` in the future | Server changes array is empty (nothing newer than future date) |
| 9 | Malformed JSON body | HTTP 400 |
| 10 | Missing required fields | HTTP 400 |

## UI test scenarios

### `shops.spec.ts`

| # | Scenario | Steps | Assertions |
|---|----------|-------|------------|
| 1 | Create a shop | Navigate to Settings → Shops; fill name + pick color; save | Shop row visible; color dot matches |
| 2 | Edit a shop name | Click edit on existing shop; change name; save | New name displayed |
| 3 | Delete a shop | Click delete; confirm | Row removed; associated shop dots gone from item cards |

### `items.spec.ts`

| # | Scenario | Steps | Assertions |
|---|----------|-------|------------|
| 1 | Create an item | Items tab → Add; enter name; save | Card appears in repository |
| 2 | Add a tag | Open item detail; add tag "dairy"; save | TagBadge "dairy" visible on card |
| 3 | Assign shops to item | Open item detail; toggle two shops; save | Two ShopDots visible on card |
| 4 | Edit default quantity + unit | Open detail; set qty 2, unit "kg"; save | Detail screen shows updated values |
| 5 | View purchase stats | Seed some session_items via API; open detail | History table has rows; "last bought" is populated |
| 6 | Search items | Type in search box | Only matching items shown |

### `lists.spec.ts`

| # | Scenario | Steps | Assertions |
|---|----------|-------|------------|
| 1 | Create a list | Lists tab → New list; name it | List card visible |
| 2 | Add item to list via search | Open list; type item name in search; tap result | Item card appears in browse mode |
| 3 | Add item via suggestions panel | Open list; open suggestions; tap a frequent item | Item added to list |
| 4 | Remove item from list | Long-press or tap remove on item card | Item no longer in list |
| 5 | Delete a list | Lists tab → delete; confirm | List card removed |

### `shopping.spec.ts`

| # | Scenario | Steps | Assertions |
|---|----------|-------|------------|
| 1 | Enter shopping mode | Open list; tap "Start shopping" for a shop | Shop dot for that shop highlighted; other items dimmed |
| 2 | Mark item as bought (swipe) | Swipe item card right | Item moves to "bought" section; crossed out |
| 3 | Skip shop for item | Swipe item card left | ShopDot for current shop shows strikethrough; item stays active |
| 4 | Undo bought | Tap bought item | Returns to active state |
| 5 | End session | Tap "Done shopping" | Session saved; navigate back to browse mode |
| 6 | Session persists on reload | End session; reload page | Bought items remain bought; session_items seeded |

### `conflicts.spec.ts`

| # | Scenario | Steps | Assertions |
|---|----------|-------|------------|
| 1 | Conflict badge visible | Seed a conflict via API (two writes to same entity after lastSyncedAt); trigger sync | SyncStatusBar shows conflict indicator |
| 2 | Conflicts screen | Navigate to conflicts screen | List of conflicted entities shown |
| 3 | Resolve conflict — keep server | Click "Keep server" | Conflict cleared; server value shown |
| 4 | Resolve conflict — keep client | Click "Keep mine" | Conflict cleared; client value shown |

### `offline.spec.ts`

| # | Scenario | Steps | Assertions |
|---|----------|-------|------------|
| 1 | Create item while offline | DevTools → offline; add item | Item appears immediately in UI (Dexie write) |
| 2 | Sync on reconnect | Go back online | Item syncs; `pendingSyncIds` cleared (no error badge) |
| 3 | Browse list offline | Load list; go offline; navigate around | All data still accessible |

---

## Fixtures (`fixtures/grocery.ts`)

Shared helpers available in every test via Playwright's `test.extend`:

```ts
interface GroceryFixtures {
  // Seed entities directly via API (bypass UI for speed)
  seedViaApi(data: Partial<SyncChanges>): Promise<void>
  // Reset the DB to empty by calling sync with deleted_at on everything
  resetViaApi(): Promise<void>
  // Navigate to a page and wait for Dexie hydration (bootstrap complete)
  gotoList(listId: string): Promise<void>
  // Swipe an item card (simulates touch gesture)
  swipeCard(locator: Locator, direction: 'left' | 'right'): Promise<void>
}
```

---

## Playwright configuration (`playwright.config.ts`)

```ts
{
  globalSetup:    './global-setup.ts',
  globalTeardown: './global-teardown.ts',
  use: {
    baseURL:    'http://localhost:8080',
    headless:   true,          // explicit; also the default
    trace:      'on-first-retry',
    screenshot: 'only-on-failure',
  },
  projects: [
    { name: 'api',    testDir: './api', use: { browserName: 'chromium' } },
    { name: 'chrome', testDir: './ui',  use: { browserName: 'chromium' } },
    {
      name: 'mobile',
      testDir: './ui',
      // Device emulation: viewport (412×915), touch events, mobile UA.
      // No real device needed — runs fully headless.
      use: devices['Pixel 7'],
    },
  ],
  retries:  1,
  workers:  4,
}
```

Both projects run headless. The `mobile` project is pure emulation — Playwright sets
the viewport to 412×915, enables touch event APIs, and sends the Pixel 7 user-agent.
No physical device or display server (Xvfb) required.

## Running the suite

```bash
# From project root
npm --prefix e2e install
npx playwright test --config e2e/playwright.config.ts

# API tests only (fast, no browser)
npx playwright test --project=api

# Mobile emulation only
npx playwright test --project=mobile

# Headed mode for local debugging (opens a real browser window)
npx playwright test --project=chrome --headed

# Generate trace viewer report on failure
npx playwright show-report e2e/playwright-report
```

## What this does NOT cover

- **Performance / load testing** — out of scope; the app is a single-user home server.
- **PWA / installability** — intentionally deferred per design decisions.
- **Cross-browser (Safari, Firefox)** — can be added as Playwright projects later; not
  in initial scope.
- **Auth** — no auth by design.
